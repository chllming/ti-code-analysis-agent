Flake8 MCP Server Experiment
Experiment Details
Component Name: mcp
Type: Server
Technology: Python (Flask)
Pillar: Agency
Purpose
This experiment implements a Python-based Model Command Protocol (MCP) server that integrates Flake8 static code analysis directly into Cursor IDE. By adhering to the MCP specification, the server provides a standardized integration point for external code quality tools. This not only validates the Agency Pillar's Tool Selection Layer but also demonstrates how Cursor’s AI can autonomously invoke and interpret static analysis, setting the stage for future extensions.

Current Implementation
Flask Web Server: Implements the MCP protocol via a JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant /mcp endpoint.
Tool Integration: Currently supports Flake8 for static code analysis.
File Handling: Secure temporary file management for incoming Python files.
Response Standardization: Formats Flake8 results for direct consumption by Cursor’s AI.
Cursor Integration: Configured within Cursor’s MCP settings for seamless invocation.
Expected Outcomes
Successful Integration: Enable Cursor to run Flake8 analysis through natural language commands.
Proof of Concept: Validate the MCP integration pattern for future tool extensions.
Extended Capabilities: Lay the groundwork for incorporating additional tools such as Black (formatting) and Bandit (security analysis).
Technical Specifications
The MCP server is built using Flask and follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. It exposes a /mcp endpoint that supports these methods:

initialize: Establishes the server connection.
tools/list: Returns a list of available tools (initially Flake8).
tools/call: Executes a specified tool (e.g., Flake8) on provided code.
The server:

Accepts Python files via JSON.
Writes them securely to a temporary directory.
Runs Flake8 with predefined configuration.
Returns structured, standardized results (including file name, line, column, error code, and message).
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Environment Setup
Create a Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy
python -m venv mcp_env
source mcp_env/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install Flask flake8
Configure Flake8:
Create a .flake8 file with rules (e.g., max line length, ignored warnings).
2. Server Implementation
Develop the Flask Application:
Create a file (e.g., mcp_server.py) that implements the MCP protocol.
Include a JSON-RPC 2.0 /mcp endpoint that handles methods such as initialize, tools/list, and tools/call.
Implement Secure File Handling:
Use Python’s tempfile module to write received code into a temporary directory.
Integrate Flake8:
Run Flake8 as a subprocess on the temporary files and parse the output into a standardized JSON format.
3. Flake8 Integration
Core Functionality:
Accept Python code from Cursor via JSON.
Run Flake8 analysis.
Parse results to include file, line, column, error code, and message.
Response Format:
Ensure the results are JSON-RPC compliant for easy integration into Cursor’s workflow.
4. Cursor Integration
Configure MCP Settings in Cursor:
Add the MCP server URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000/mcp) within Cursor.
Enable the server and validate its response with sample Python files.
Natural Language Invocation:
Users can now use prompts such as:
nginx
Copy
Run Flake8 analysis on @src/module.py.
Cursor will pass the file to the MCP server, receive analysis results, and integrate them into its interface.
5. Extensions and Future Enhancements
Next Steps:
Black Integration:
Add an endpoint (e.g., /run_black) to format code automatically and return the formatted version or diff.
Bandit Integration:
Introduce a security analysis endpoint (e.g., /run_bandit) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Additional Tools:
Consider integrating MyPy for static type checking and Pylint for enhanced linting.
Performance Optimizations:
Implement caching, parallel processing, and incremental analysis for improved efficiency.
Testing Methodology

# Code Quality Tools Integration

## Flake8 Static Analysis
- Utilize the Flake8 MCP tool to inspect Python code for style issues.
- Address all linting warnings before committing.
- Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines and follow project-specific rules.
- Run Flake8 analysis on demand via natural language commands.

## Black Code Formatting (Next Step)
- Use the Black MCP tool to format code.
- Enforce a consistent 88-character line length and style.
- Run Black before committing changes.

## Bandit Security Analysis (Next Step)
- Execute Bandit to identify security vulnerabilities.
- Prioritize fixing HIGH severity issues and documenting MEDIUM ones.
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipelines.

Integration with TI Architecture
This experiment validates:

Agency Pillar Integration: Demonstrates how the Tool Selection Layer integrates external tools using standardized protocols.
Cross-Component Communication: Uses JSON-RPC for effective communication between Cursor’s AI and external services.
Extensibility: Establishes a framework to add additional code quality tools, ensuring future scalability.
Conclusion
The Flake8 MCP Server experiment successfully demonstrates how to integrate external code quality tools into Cursor’s AI workflow. By standardizing the communication via the MCP protocol, this approach not only validates the Agency Pillar’s design but also provides a robust blueprint for future integrations with tools like Black and Bandit. This experiment enhances AI-assisted development by ensuring that every piece of generated code adheres to high-quality standards.
