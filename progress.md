Created a testing script to facilitate pipeline validation. Ensured the workflow uses the latest GitHub Actions syntax and security best practices.

- [x] Task 5.4: Configure monitoring, logging, and scaling - 2025-03-09
  - Notes: Implemented structured JSON logging for better log analysis. Created a metrics module to track request counts, response times, and error rates. Added health check and metrics endpoints for monitoring. Updated the Dockerfile and railway.toml with appropriate environment variables and scaling configurations. Created comprehensive documentation for monitoring, logging, and scaling in Railway.

- [x] Task 1.2: Configure Cursor IDE for Development
  - **Completed Date**: 2025-03-09
  - **Notes**: Configured Cursor IDE with optimized settings, proper rule files, and validation script. All tests pass successfully.

- [x] Task 3.1: Implement Black code formatter integration
  - **Completed Date**: 2025-03-09
  - **Notes**: Successfully implemented Black code formatter integration in the MCP server. Added support for both formatting and checking operations, with configurable options like line length and string normalization. Created comprehensive tests to verify the functionality, including unit tests and integration tests. Updated the tools/list and tools/call endpoints to include Black as a supported tool.

- [x] Task 3.2: Implement Bandit security analysis integration
  - **Completed Date**: 2025-03-09
  - **Notes**: Successfully implemented Bandit security analysis integration in the MCP server. Added support for configurable severity and confidence levels, with proper parsing and standardization of security issues. Created comprehensive tests to verify the functionality, including unit tests and integration tests. Updated the tools/list and tools/call endpoints to include Bandit as a supported tool.
