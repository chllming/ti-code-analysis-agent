# Testing Guidelines

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests must cover at least 85% of code
- All public interfaces must have comprehensive test coverage
- All edge cases and error conditions must be tested
- Critical paths must have 100% test coverage
- Tests must be maintained and updated alongside code changes

## Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components
- **Functional Tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Verify response time and resource usage
- **Security Tests**: Verify security mechanisms and identify vulnerabilities

## Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Use tests to define and verify requirements
- Refactor code only after tests are passing
- Maintain test independence to allow parallel execution
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Test Structure Guidelines
- Each test should focus on a single aspect of functionality
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Setup and teardown should be clean and efficient
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use fixtures for common test data

## Test Maintenance
- Keep tests up to date with code changes
- Refactor tests when refactoring code
- Delete tests for removed functionality
- Add tests for new functionality
- Document test approach and any special testing requirements
- Ensure tests remain fast and reliable

## Test Automation
- Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
- Run tests automatically on code changes
- Set up test environments that mirror production
- Generate test reports and track coverage over time
- Use code coverage tools appropriate for your language
- Implement visual testing for UI components when applicable
