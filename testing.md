# Ti-code-analysis-agent Testing Documentation

## Test Framework

### Overview
This project uses pytest for Python components and Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript components. The test structure mirrors the source code structure to ensure clear organization and easy navigation.

### Running Tests

#### Local Environment
```bash
# For Python projects
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file or directory
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_specific_module.py

# Run tests with coverage reporting
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# For JavaScript/TypeScript projects
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file or pattern
npm test -- -t "pattern"

# Run tests with coverage reporting
npm test -- --coverage
```

#### Docker Environment
```bash
# Run all tests in Docker
docker-compose run --rm test

# Run specific tests in Docker (Python)
docker-compose run --rm test python -m pytest tests/unit/test_specific_module.py

# Run specific tests in Docker (JavaScript)
docker-compose run --rm test npm test -- -t "pattern"

# Generate coverage report in Docker
docker-compose run --rm test python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml  # For Python
docker-compose run --rm test npm test -- --coverage  # For JavaScript
```

4. **Performance Tests**: Run performance tests (nightly)
5. **Security Tests**: Run security tests
6. **Coverage Report**: Generate and publish coverage report

## Test Design Guidelines

### Unit Test Structure
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern (Given-When-Then)
- Test one behavior per test function
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests isolated and independent

### Python Example:
```python
def test_process_data_returns_correct_format_for_valid_input():
    """Test that process_data returns correctly formatted result for valid input."""
    # Arrange
    processor = DataProcessor()
    input_data = {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}
    expected_keys = ["processed_key1", "processed_key2", "timestamp"]
    
    # Act
    result = processor.process_data(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert isinstance(result, dict)
    assert all(key in result for key in expected_keys)
    assert result["processed_key1"] == "processed_value1"
    assert result["processed_key2"] == 84
```

### JavaScript Example:
```javascript
test('processData returns correct format for valid input', () => {
  // Arrange
  const processor = new DataProcessor();
  const inputData = { key1: 'value1', key2: 42 };
  const expectedKeys = ['processedKey1', 'processedKey2', 'timestamp'];
  
  // Act
  const result = processor.processData(inputData);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result).toBeInstanceOf(Object);
  expectedKeys.forEach(key => expect(result).toHaveProperty(key));
  expect(result.processedKey1).toBe('processed_value1');
  expect(result.processedKey2).toBe(84);
});
```

### Integration Test Design
- Focus on component interactions
- Mock external dependencies unless testing the integration
- Test realistic workflows
- Verify data passes correctly between components

### Performance Test Design
- Define clear metrics and thresholds
- Create realistic test scenarios
- Test with production-like data volumes
- Isolate system under test from testing infrastructure

## Cursor AI-Assisted Testing

### Overview
This project leverages Cursor AI to assist with various testing tasks, from generating test cases to analyzing code coverage and suggesting improvements.

### Test Generation Workflows

#### Generating Unit Tests
To generate unit tests for a component or function:
1. Open the file containing the code to test
2. Open Cursor Composer (âŒ˜+I or Ctrl+I)
3. Request: "Generate comprehensive unit tests for [component/function]"
4. Review, modify if needed, and save the generated tests

#### Generating Integration Tests
To generate integration tests:
1. Open the relevant files containing components that interact
2. Open Cursor Composer
3. Request: "Create integration tests for the interaction between [component1] and [component2]"
4. Review, adapt as needed, and save the tests

### Coverage Analysis
Cursor AI can help analyze test coverage reports:
1. Run your tests with coverage reporting
2. Open the coverage report or summary
3. Ask Cursor: "Analyze this coverage report and suggest areas that need more testing"

### Test Improvement
For improving existing tests:
1. Open the test file
2. Ask Cursor: "Review these tests and suggest improvements for better coverage and reliability"
3. Implement the suggested improvements

### Test Debugging
When tests are failing:
1. Open the failing test and related implementation
2. Ask Cursor: "Help me understand why this test is failing and how to fix it"
3. Implement the suggested solutions

### Best Practices
- Ensure test files follow the naming conventions described in this document
- Review AI-generated tests carefully before committing
- Use Cursor to help refactor tests when underlying code changes
- Consider asking Cursor to optimize slow-running tests
